#Emsi Project
##by Caleb Bray

This is my project that I completed for my interview with Emsi. My task was to take
JSON data and use it to create a page that displays the information given.
The data shows statistics on growth and numbers of jobs for computer programmers
in regional, state, and national categories.

In order to run this project, I would suggest two options. Either create a local host
to view the webpage in Google Chrome (I created this page using the Atom text editor and their
live server add on). The webpage can also be opened dragging the index.html file onto
Firefox.

###Note to the reviewer:
The mock up shows data ranging from the years 2001 - 2025.
However there is only complete data for the years 2013 - 2017. In the mockup, this makes
the growth rate of the nations computer programmers to be roughly 2% slower than Regional
and state data. I thought that the only appropriate way to accurately display the
information would be to only display the years with the complete data.

If the data were to be complete for 2018, the following lines can be commented out
and the proper lines could be uncommented.
